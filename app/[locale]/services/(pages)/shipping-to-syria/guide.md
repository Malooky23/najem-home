-   **`next/head`:** Use the `<Head>` component from `next/head` to manage your title tags, meta descriptions, and other meta tags for each page.
-   **`next/image`:** Use the `<Image>` component from `next/image` for optimized image loading and performance.
-   **Sitemap:** Generate a sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) and submit it to Google Search Console. Next.ts has packages to help with this.
-   **Robots.txt:** Ensure your `robots.txt` file is configured correctly to allow search engines to crawl your site.
-   **Structured Data (Schema Markup):** Implement schema markup (using JSON-LD) to provide additional context to search engines about your content. Relevant schema types include:
    -   `Organization` (for your company)
    -   `LocalBusiness` (for your physical location)
    -   `Service` (for your shipping services)
    -   `FAQPage` (for your FAQ section)
    -   `BreadcrumbList` (for breadcrumbs)
    -   `WebSite`
-   **Performance Optimization:**
    -   Next.ts is already quite performant, but ensure you're following best practices:
        -   Optimize images.
        -   Minify CSS and JavaScript.
        -   Leverage browser caching.
        -   Use a CDN.
-   **Mobile-First Design:** Ensure your website is fully responsive and works well on all devices.
